I often play videos in the background when I work. I got sick of having the window be in the way of everything no matter how small I made the video window. So here's a video player with transparency so you can see what's behind without having to move the window. Base of the player is from [this repo](https://github.com/RIAEvangelist/electron-video-player)

## Things to do

- [ ] Add more configurable options
- [ ] Possibly switch to using [libvlc](https://github.com/RSATom/WebChimera.js) for more codec/file type support
- [ ] Extract video from url from sites like YouTube
